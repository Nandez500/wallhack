# Wallhack: in-wall infrastructure mapping system
The Wallhack in-wall infrastructure mapping system is utilizes the Walabot development platform to graphically map the location of wood and metal studs on an image of the wall.

# Workflow Example
This is an example of a software workflow I want us all to follow:
1. Choose an issue from the list
2. Create a new branch for the issue in the format: issue#-issue-name
3. Implement the new feature/bugfix in the new branch
4. When finished, create pull request
5. Notify the group to review request
6. Fix problems, if any
7. After review, Brandon will merge branch and close issue
8. Profit :)

Notes: Commit often, always include descriptive commit messages.
